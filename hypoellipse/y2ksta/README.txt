Codes for reformatting old station sists to span the 2000 millenium

This directory contains source code and UNIX-executable files related to updating 
station lists with time-dependent parameters that were in use before 1999.

The following is a list of the files with a description:

y2ksta.f 
	Program source code for expanding the format of the year in a station list 
	file with time-dependent parameters from two digits to four digits in order 
	to accommodate the transition to a new millenium.

	The executable code for this program is generated by running the makefile
	in the "source" folder

del_cent.f
	Program source code that removes the first two digits from summary records 
	generated by the Y2K compliant version of HYPOELLIPSE to facilitate comparison
